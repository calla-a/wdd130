            <p>Hello, my name is Raul Rosales. I am from Guatemala, and I live in a small town in the western part of the country. I have lived here practically my entire life. The weather is very good; even in the summer months, it doesn't get very hot, which I love. I also enjoy playing video games.</p>

            <p>Guatemala, a Central American country south of Mexico, has volcanoes, tropical forests, and ancient Mayan sites. I took this photo on a trip to Lake Atitlan, one of the most visited tourist destinations in the country. Just around this lake, there are three volcanoes. The name "Guatemala" is believed to derive from the Nahuatl word "CuauhtƒìmallƒÅn", which means "place of many trees" or "land of trees".</p>
